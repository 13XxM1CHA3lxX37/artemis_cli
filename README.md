# artemis-cli
A command-line application for tutors to more productively grade programming excises on ArTEMiS
## Beta notice
This program is still in beta and hasn't been thoroughly tested yet, make sure your grades were actually submitted properly.

## Overview and purpose
Used for the introductory course "Praktikum Grundlagen der Programmierung"
[IN0002](https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/wbModHb.wbShowMHBReadOnly?pKnotenNr=452806) at TU Munich.
The course teaches first-year students from a wide range of Computer Science related study programs
the fundamentals of object-oriented programming.

The course is facilitated on/ supported by the interactive learning tool ArTEMiS
(http://www.interactive-learning.org). ArTEMiS allows tutors to download the repositories of student's
exercises in order to grade them. **This script assists the relevant steps in the grading process.**

## First steps
1. Add your ArTEMiS credentials (username and password) into `config.yml`
   * Remember to untrack the changes to this file before redistributing: `git update-index --assume-unchanged config.yml`
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x artemis-cli.py`
3. Install dependencies via `pip install pyyaml argparse requests json`


## Supported commands (continuously updated)
1. `repos`  Downloading all student repos
2. `grade`  Grade a student individually
3. `grades` Grade all students for an assignment using a gradebook generated by the download repos command.
            The only format for gradebook implemented as of now is YAML (.yml)
