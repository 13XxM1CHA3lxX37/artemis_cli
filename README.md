# artemis-cli
A command-line application for tutors to more productively grade programming excises on ArTEMiS

## Beta notice
This program is still in beta and hasn't been thoroughly tested yet, make sure your grades were actually submitted properly.

## Overview and purpose
Used for the introductory course "Praktikum Grundlagen der Programmierung"
[IN0002](https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/wbModHb.wbShowMHBReadOnly?pKnotenNr=452806) at TU Munich.
The course teaches first-year students from a wide range of Computer Science related study programs
the fundamentals of object-oriented programming.

The course is facilitated on/ supported by the interactive learning tool ArTEMiS
(http://www.interactive-learning.org). ArTEMiS allows tutors to download the repositories of student's
exercises in order to grade them. **This script assists the relevant steps in the grading process.**

## First steps
1. Add your ArTEMiS credentials (username and password) into `config.yml`
   * Remember to untrack the changes to this file before redistributing: `git update-index --assume-unchanged config.yml`
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x artemis_cli.py`
3. Install dependencies via `pip install pyyaml argparse requests`

Run the script via `./artemis_cli.py <command>`


## Supported commands (continuously updated)
1. `repos`  Download all student repos
2. `grade`  Grade a student individually
3. `grades` Grade all students for an assignment. A gradebook, that is generated by the `repos` command for all 
students to be graded, is used. The only format for gradebook implemented as of now is YAML (.yml)

## Commands
Help to all available commands can be acquired by using the help flag (`-h` or `--help`). 
The following show those help outputs. However, the most up-to-date help can be found through said flags.

Below, for example, `./artemis_cli.py -h` was called:
```
usage: artemis_cli.py [-h] [-q | -v] {repos,grade,grades} ...
